This sample of code (repository) is used to make the Static Analysis and to find the efficiency between the PC Lint and Code Sonar tools which are Static Analysis Tools.

Static Analysis: 
  Static Analysis is a type of analysis that is done over the code, which is generated by a developer without conducting any code execution. This is done by code review, if we have access to source code or else we need to do reverse engineering or some kind of binary analysis.
  
Dynamic Analysis:
    We run the application and we can monitor as it was running and we can interact with the application as the aim of finding bugs. We can do Dynamic Analysis by Fuzzing/Tampering/ Functional Testing/ Traditional Penetration test. All these tests fall under Dynamic Analysis.
    
Fuzzing: 
    Fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves in providing invalid/ unexpected/ random data as inputs to a computer program.
    
What kind of errors are reviewed during Static Analysis:
  1. Standards, 
  2. Design Rules,
  3. Code review.
  
What do we detect during Static Analysis:
  1. Malicious Code, 
  2. Bad use of rules and standards,
  3. Bad use of resources.

When Static Analysis should be applied to Source Code: 
  Static Analysis should be right from the begining of code implementation and goes till Integration and Testing of the code.
